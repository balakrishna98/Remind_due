# Remind Due – Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** September 13, 2025

Remind Due is designed to work fully **offline**. We do **not** collect, transmit, store, or sell personal data on our servers.

## Data Stored on Your Device
- Reminders you create (title, date/time, repeat)
- Optional amount and notes
- Optional photos/receipts you attach

All data is stored **locally on your device** and is not uploaded anywhere by the app.

## Permissions We Request
- **Notifications** – to schedule local reminder alerts.
- **Photos** – only if you choose to attach a photo/receipt to a reminder. We access only the items you select.

## Analytics, Ads, and Tracking
- No analytics
- No third-party advertising SDKs
- No tracking across apps or websites

## Accounts
Remind Due does not use accounts or cloud services.

## Data Retention & Deletion
Data remains on your device until you delete it in the app or uninstall the app (which removes all app data). Removing an attached photo/receipt in the app deletes that file from the app’s storage area.

## Children’s Privacy
The app is suitable for all ages and does not collect personal information.
